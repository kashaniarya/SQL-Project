The main tasks involve loading data from a Movie Rating dataset, 
creating relational tables, implementing range and round-robin partitioning methods, 
and inserting new data into the appropriate partitions.

Key Objectives:

Link a database in a Python file and write queries within Python.
Implement Python functions to observe how round-robin and range partitions function.
Reproduce the use of virtual machine software.

Technology Requirements:

Python
PostgreSQL

Assignment Description:

Input data is a Movie Rating dataset with 10 million ratings, 100,000 tag applications, 10,000 movies, and 72,000 users.
Python functions should be implemented to load this data into a PostgreSQL table, 
perform range and round-robin partitioning, and insert new data into the partitions.
