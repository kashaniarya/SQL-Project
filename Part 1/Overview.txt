Objectives include creating tables with appropriate data types, 
adding rows, establishing relationships, and understanding keys and constraints. 

The technology requirement is PostgreSQL.

Part 1 involves creating seven tables: users, movies, taginfo, genres, ratings, tags, and hasagenre. 
Each table has specific attributes with defined data types, and some attributes serve as primary or foreign keys.
